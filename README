QPROP v3.2 for windows

The subdirectory ./base/ contains the source files of the qprop library and a Makefile to build the library.
If you plan to use a different compiler than g++ you need to modify this Makefile.

The subdirectory ./plots/ contains Python scripts for visualising the qprop-produced results.

Other subdirectorires are devoted to various examples. Go to a folder of interest, execute the bash script by typing ./do_all.sh in it and get the results in a while.
